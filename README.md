# Vue.js course

This project is meant to teach Vue.js fundamentals by creating a blog, step by step. It uses the [Material Design / Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) framework and stores its data in the Google [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) cloud.

Follow these steps to continuously build a client-side Blog web app with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html).

## 1. Create project

import ZumRezept from "@/views/posts/Read.vue";
import Create from "@/views/posts/Create.vue";

const routes = [
  {path: '/', component: Overview},
  {path: '/posts', component: Overview},
  {path: '/posts/:id', component: Read},
  {path: '/posts/create', component: Create},
